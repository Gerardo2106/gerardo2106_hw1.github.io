            <h2>Overview and History</h2>
            <p>
                The von Neumann architecture is basically the blueprint that most modern computers follow today.
                It was first introduced by John von Neumann back in 1945 and completely changed how computers were
                designed.
                What made it so revolutionary was the idea of storing both the program instructions and the actual data
                in the same memory.
                Before this, computers had separate storage for instructions and data, which was way more complicated.
                This unified approach to memory is still the standard that pretty much all computers use nowadays,
                showing just how ahead of its time von Neumann's design really was.

            <h2>Key Components</h2>
            <p>
                The von Neumann architecture has five main parts that all work together to run programs.
                First up is the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, which acts like the brain of the
                computer and has two important pieces: the <abbr title="Arithmetic Logic Unit">ALU</abbr> that handles
                all the math and logical operations, and the Control Unit that manages everything and makes
                sure instructions get executed properly.
                Then there's the Memory Unit, which stores both the program instructions and data in one place so the
                processor can access everything quickly.
                CPU registers are super fast storage spots where data has to go before it can actually be processed.
                Finally, you've got Input and Output devices that let the computer communicate with the outside world,
                like loading programs and showing results.
                All these parts are connected by buses, which are basically highways that move addresses, data, and
                control signals around between different components.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The von Neumann architecture runs on a continuous cycle called fetch-decode-execute-store that processes
                instructions one by one.
                First, during the fetch step, the Control Unit grabs the next instruction from memory using an address
                that's stored in something called the Program Counter.
                Then in the decode step, the instruction gets broken down to figure out what operation needs to happen
                and where the data is.
                Next comes the execute step where the ALU actually does the operation on the data.
                Finally, in the store step, the result gets written back to memory where it's supposed to go.
                This whole cycle just keeps repeating over and over, handling each instruction one at a time until the
                program finishes running.
                It's a pretty straightforward process that lets computers handle really complex programs by breaking
                everything down into simple steps that happen in order.
