            <h3>What is Majorana 1</h3>
            <p>
                Microsoft's Majorana 1 is the world's first quantum processor that uses something called topological
                qubits, which is a completely different approach to building quantum computers.
                It was announced in February 2025 and represents a major shift in how quantum computing could work.
                Regular quantum computers from companies like Google and IBM use superconducting qubits or trapped ions,
                but these are super fragile and prone to errors.
                Majorana 1 takes a different route by using exotic particles called Majorana zero modes that exist at
                the ends of special superconducting wires.
                The chip is built using a brand new material Microsoft created called a topoconductor, which is made by
                combining indium arsenide and aluminum at the atomic level.
                When cooled down to near absolute zero and hit with magnetic fields, this material creates the
                topological superconducting state where these <abbr title="Majorana Zero Modes">MZM</abbr> particles can
                exist and be controlled.

            <h3>How It Works and Why It's Different</h3>
            <p>
                The big deal about topological qubits is that they store quantum information in a way that's naturally
                protected from errors.
                Think of it like this: regular qubits are like writing information on individual atoms that can get
                messed up easily by any tiny disturbance in the environment.
                Topological qubits, on the other hand, encode information in the overall shape or topology of the
                system, kind of like tying knots in a string where small vibrations don't untie the knot.
                This makes them way more stable and resistant to the noise and interference that usually destroys
                quantum information.
                The Majorana 1 chip currently has eight qubits, which seems small compared to other quantum computers
                with hundreds or thousands of qubits, but the whole point is quality over quantity.
                Microsoft's roadmap shows they're aiming to scale this up to a million qubits on a single chip, which
                would be insane and could actually solve real-world problems that are impossible for today's computers.

            <h3>Challenges and Future Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Not everyone in the scientific community is totally convinced yet that Microsoft has actually created
                true Majorana zero modes.
                There's been some controversy because it's really hard to prove these particles exist versus other
                similar quantum effects that aren't topologically protected.
                Microsoft had to retract a paper back in 2018 about similar claims, so there's definitely some
                skepticism out there.
                Despite the debate, if this technology actually works as promised, it could be a game-changer for
                quantum computing.
                The potential applications are pretty wild - things like breaking down microplastics into harmless
                materials, discovering new drugs by simulating molecular interactions, creating new materials with
                properties we can't even imagine yet, and revolutionizing cryptography.
                Microsoft is working on building what they call a fault-tolerant prototype within the next few years,
                which would be the first quantum computer reliable enough to actually use for practical problems instead
                of just research demonstrations.
