            <h2>What is Computer Architecture?</h2>
            <p>
                Computer architecture refers to the collection of rules and methodologies that outline how computers
                function, are managed, and implemented.
                Essentially, it establishes the guidelines governing how a system operates and performs tasks.
                The primary purpose of computer architecture is to maintain equilibrium among a computer system's
                performance capabilities, operational efficiency, financial cost, and dependability.
            </p>
            <h3>Main Categories</h3>
            <p>
                Computer architecture divides into three primary categories.
                The first is Instruction Set Architecture (<abbr title="Instruction Set Architecture">ISA</abbr>), which
                serves as the connection between a computer's software and hardware components.
                It determines how processors interpret and execute instructions, manages memory allocation for
                instructions, and handles different memory addressing methods.
                The second category is Microarchitecture, which explains how specific processors execute the
                instructions defined by the ISA.
                Finally, System Design encompasses all additional hardware elements in the system, including components
                for virtualization and multiprocessing capabilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>
                Computer architecture has evolved to serve different computational needs across various fields.
                In general computing, it powers everyday tasks like web browsing and document processing.
                For specialized AI processing, architecture enables machine learning and neural network calculations.
                The field of graphics and gaming relies on architecture for high-performance visual rendering.
                Scientific research uses advanced computer architecture for complex simulations and quantum computing
                applications.

        <h2>Three significant developments</h2>
        <div class="main1">
            <h3>Von Neumann Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                This foundational design introduced the revolutionary concept of storing both program instructions and
                data in the same memory,
                establishing the basic blueprint that nearly all modern computers still follow today.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="main2">
            <h3>Google Tensor Processing Unit(TPU)</h3>
            <p>
                A specialized processor designed specifically to accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning
                calculations,
                demonstrating how modern architecture has evolved to create custom hardware for specific computational
                tasks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="main3">
            <h3>Microsoft's Majorana 1</h3>
            <p>
                A cutting-edge quantum computing chip that uses topological qubits to process information through
                quantum mechanical principles,
                promising to solve problems that are impossible for traditional computers.
